Salesperson: Hello sir, welcome to YoCars Park. How can I assist you today? 
Customer: I'm not sure yet. 
Salesperson: No problem. Are you looking to shift to a new vehicle? May I have your contact number to keep you updated with our latest offers? 
Customer: Sure, it's 99******90. 
Salesperson: Great, thank you. Have you visited YoCars Park before? 
Customer: Yes, I have. 
Salesperson: Did you encounter any issues during your visit? 
Customer: Yes, I had some concerns about the processing fees and other charges. 
Salesperson: I understand. The processing fees are typically covered by the bank. Are you in need of some cash for the purchase? 
Customer: Yes, that would be helpful. 
Salesperson: Give me 5 minutes to arrange everything. I'll bring the car around for you to see. 
Customer: Okay. 
Salesperson: By the way, what's the main issue you're facing? 
Customer: I'm from Delhi, and I'm worried about the paperwork and additional costs. 
Salesperson: Don't worry. We handle all the paperwork, including RC transfer and any other necessary documents. The company covers these costs, so you won't have to pay extra. We ensure everything is included in the price. 
Customer: That sounds good, but I'm still concerned about the price. It seems a bit expensive. 
Salesperson: I understand your concern. Our prices are fixed, but they include all the features and services we offer. This means no hidden costs or additional charges later on. You're getting a comprehensive package. 
Salesperson: If the papers are proper, we can't come here with other vehicles. If there's a problem with NOCL, we can't sell the vehicle. We've included all that in the price. There's no need to charge more. It's just that it's a bit late to get the RC. You need to buy the alternative documents. No one will create any problem for you. You've given us a delivery note. We've purchased it from YoCars. We're waiting for the RC card. If you show it to us, you won't be in any trouble. 
Salesperson: If there's a chance, you can see this. 
Customer: This? 
Salesperson: Yes. Wait a minute. What did you say, sir? Did you reduce it? 
Customer: No. 
Salesperson: You won't get anything in YoCars. You can keep it as a backup vehicle. We don't sell it as a meter tamper. 
Customer: Is that company selling it as a meter tamper? What's there for the customer? Is it a meter tamper that doesn't come to YoCars? 
Salesperson: It's one lakh per year. In one year, there are vehicles that run 80,000 miles. In 10 years, there are vehicles that run 20,000 or 30,000 miles. But all the customers have kept it as a backup vehicle. It's an extra vehicle. It's not at home. That's why they keep it like that. In case you have any doubt, go and check with the mechanic.
