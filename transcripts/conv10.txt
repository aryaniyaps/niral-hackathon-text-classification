Salesperson: Yes, sir. Could I have your contact number for our records? 
Customer: 7******139. 
Salesperson: Thank you. No problem, just for logging purposes. Do you have a shortlist of cars you're interested in? 
Customer: Just give me two minutes, ma'am. I will get the vehicle and I will call you. 
Salesperson: Okay, I will call you. 
Salesperson: Sir, we kept it just for display purposes. Sir, there is a stone. I think it will hit there. 
Customer: Slowly, sir. 
Salesperson: I have left you, ma'am. 
Customer: Sir? 
Salesperson: It has been leaked for the first time. It's too loose. There was greasing and all. 
Customer: Is it too loose? 
Salesperson: No, no. I mean, we brought an item. So, we have compared it. It differs from brand to brand. The steering is a bit tight in the Volkswagen, but it depends on the company. In the Tata, it is much smoother. I can turn it with one finger. 
Customer: What is the vibration? Light vibration? 
Customer: Clutch in the lower gear is vibrating. Do you want to try? 
Salesperson: No, you stop here near the tree. We will check the engine and boot space. 
Customer: No, you want to try once? 
Salesperson: No, it's okay. You can see the engine from the inside. Start the engine from the inside. 
Salesperson: It is not in gear. It started. You can see the power of the accelerator. It is 1.2. It is a powerful engine. 
Customer: No, you stop here. You can turn the car. 
Salesperson: No, you stop here. You can see the power of the accelerator. 
Customer: No, you start from the inside. 
Salesperson: No, you start from the inside. 
Customer: No, you start from the inside. 
Salesperson: You just drive. 
Customer: I will. 
Salesperson: No, you stop here. 
Customer: I don't want to talk. 
Salesperson: No, you stop here. 
Customer: Then it will stand. 
Salesperson: No, you stop here. 
Customer: You stand. 
Salesperson: Then I will move. 
Customer: No, you speak. 
Salesperson: No, you speak. 
Customer: Then it will take a while. 
Salesperson: No, you speak. 
Customer: By the way, I find the price a bit expensive. Is there any room for negotiation? 
Salesperson: I understand your concern, sir. However, our prices are fixed. But let me assure you, the price includes all the features and benefits our company offers. From registration to after-sales service, everything is covered. 
Customer: Hmm, I see. That does sound comprehensive.
