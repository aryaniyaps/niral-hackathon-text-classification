Customer: It's good that you are advertising the price of the car. 
Salesperson: There is no body work. Everyone is mentioned here. The door is repainted and the apple is mentioned. The door is repainted. The dent and scratches are not there. We are asking for the comparison. That's why we are asking for the price.
